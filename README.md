ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project!

Iâ€™ve created my own portfolio website using React.js and the Vite.js plugin for React. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in modern web development, leveraging React for building interactive user interfaces and Vite.js for an optimized development experience. Check it out to see my work, skills, and the projects Iâ€™m passionate about!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
